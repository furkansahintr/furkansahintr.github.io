A few words about me

#intro
I was born in Istanbul, but my roots trace back to Trabzon. I have been working in the fields of software and design for over 4 years. As a frontend developer and designer, I enjoy combining aesthetics and functionality to create user-centered projects. My interest in philosophy, metaphysics, and space science strengthens my analytical approach to software and design. I strive to improve myself with new technologies.  
<br />
I am known for my attention to detail and perfectionist attitude in every project. My goal is to always achieve the best results and provide the best experiences and solutions for people.
